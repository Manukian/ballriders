        .ballriders_style_about 
            | Ballride style is an independent branch of Freestyle Basketball culture, that values feeling and musicality in the first place. Itâ€™s goal is not only doing hard tricks and gracious transitions with a ball, but also telling a story with the body through the ball. Visualising the lyrics, making moves, that perfectly describe the sound and showing your attitude is one of the most important things in ballride style. 
            br
            | This is not the manual to how act with a ball. This is just a perception, acknowledged by world top freestylers, that can be used for creating your own story. Tutorials only include basic concepts. The rest is up to you.
